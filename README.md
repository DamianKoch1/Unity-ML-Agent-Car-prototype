# Unity-ML-Agent-Car-prototype
Small prototype containing different car controllers using wheel colliders, HingeJoints or simple Rigidbodies, wheel colliders felt too realistic (too easy to flip / lose friction), HingeJoints made turning the wheel difficult, so i went with the Rigidbodies to create self driving cars using Unity's ML Agents.
